					<h3>A new journey</h3>
					<p>After a year looking for a job, not finding anything, and kind of losing my mind, I decided to try another way and am starting this new chapter of my job hunting. This is supposed to train me in diverse programming languages, give me an opportunity to display my skills, and just study subjects that matter to me. If you are reading this, please feel free to let me know what you think about it and if you have interesting topics you think would be intersting for me, go ahead.</p>
